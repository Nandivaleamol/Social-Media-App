Social Media App Android Project:

Firstly, The name of the application is “Memer’s Katta” (Social 
Media App). It means in this app have lot of memes/videos/images can upload 
by individual user. Why we take specifically meme app when 
compared with social app. I have implemented some basic 
features as well as some advanced level. I used Java 
programming language for backend process. I used XML for 
front-end process. I am providing Firebase email authentication 
with verification of email function. The main dashboard like 
Instagram it means bottom navigation with four fragments. 
That four fragments are attached to activity which is called 
home activity or main activity. Profile fragment us major 
attraction for this application. 
In this application I was used Firebase as a database for 
save and retrieve. User can upload a post and a text (User wish). 
All posts are available to see in feed fragments which is order by 
timestamp. Post size is square because we use crop 
Dependency for this. User can search friends to see their status 
it means their photos and followers. Everyone can follow and 
unfollow by clicking a button. No hardcode are used. User can 
save posts and download posts into their gallery. User can share 
post-image to other social media or something else. The main 
thing in this application is “Offline use” it means user can see 
posts while offline and commenting. Another feature is 
commenting. This is simple layout and function. Double tap to 
like feature is also available in application.
